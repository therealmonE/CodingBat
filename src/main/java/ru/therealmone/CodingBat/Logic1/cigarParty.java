 * When squirrels get together for a party, they like to have cigars.
 * A squirrel party is successful when the number of cigars is between 40 and 60, inclusive.
 * Unless it is the weekend, in which case there is no upper bound on the number of cigars.
 * Return true if the party with the given values is successful, or false otherwise.
